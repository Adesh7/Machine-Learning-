This is very basic and very famous machine learning problem. This is the first machine learning problem that I solved on my own.
This problem is available on Kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic) 
The problem asks us to use Machine Learning and predict which of the users from the titanic shipwreck will survive and which of them will die.
